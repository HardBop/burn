""" Text Tagger:
Python file to read in blocks of text, parse out words, 
run frequency on the words, and tag the text block with 
the most frequently occurring words.

This is mostly as a python programming exercise -- next 
step would be to research proper NLP approaches and use 
best practices to tag.
